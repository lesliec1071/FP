# Medical_Options
In my website “Medical Options” I will be covering the definitions of the terms, Cure and Treatment. For each term I will have a set of benefits and disadvantages that go with the term. You would also see a tips and advice section on the website concerning the two terms. I have been able to create this website from the content I learned in class which is how to code using HTML, CSS, media queries, and containers and how to use github.
